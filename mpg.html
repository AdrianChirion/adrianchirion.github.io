<h1 class="mainHeaders" tabindex="0"> My Pet Grim </h1>
</div>

<p class="mainParagraphs" tabindex="0">Radioactive Magic is a game company that made an Android game for mobile devices (Android version 4 and up). 
    The game was to be similar to Tamagotchi except the pet that you interact with is a Grim Reaper that cannot die, the game also targeted both kids and young adults.</p>

<div class="headerContainer">
<h2 class="workHeaders" tabindex="0">Our Understanding from the Client</h2>
</div>

<p class="topParagraphs" tabindex="0">The selling point of the game is the fact that the pet is a Grim Reaper and that the Grim cannot die if left alone by the user. 
    This removes the stress of virtual pet care for adults who may not have too much time on their hands and teaches kids about the concept of death without having heartbreak from losing the pet.</p>
<p class="middleParagraphs" tabindex="0">The user is supposed to have a sense of nurturing and attachment to the Grim, this attachment would be made by physical interaction with the Grim (such as patting and poking it). 
    The game itself is also supposed to be seen and adorable and attractive.</p>
<p class="bottomParagraphs" tabindex="0">The game is free to download and play, however it does have in-app purchases and it gives users the ability to watch ads (which would be its main form of revenue) in order to gain more in-game currency (in this case souls and gems).</p>

<div class="headerContainer">
<h2 class="workHeaders" tabindex="0">Our Approach</h2>
</div>

<p class="topParagraphs" tabindex="0">Our first focus was on our first impressions of the game. We went through each menu of the game (main menu, customisation menu and so on) and wrote down our thoughts on what we believed each button did and what we thought of the UI interactions. 
    We then completed a survey that was created by Radioactive Magic and moved on to bug searching. </p>
<p class="bottomParagraphs" tabindex="0">Our bug searching mainly focused on the customisation menu, however we did do some testing in the other menus as well as on the pet. We found that the game's UI would completely disappear when certain buttons were pressed at the same time, some clothing/items clipped through the Grim, and that the actual character model of the Grim could be distorted.</p>

<div class="headerContainer">
<h2 class="workHeaders" tabindex="0">Bug Reporting and Other Documentation</h2>
</div>

<p class="topParagraphs" tabindex="0">We created a bug report repository on a Trello board. We had a list containing notes from the developer, a list with our reported bugs, and lists labeled as ACCEPTED, IN PROGRESS, and DONE to show the progress of each bug being fixed.</p>

<p class = "middleParagraphs"><a target="_blank"><img src="MPG-1.png" style='width:100%;' alt="Null"></a></p>

<p class="bottomParagraphs" tabindex="0">After finishing up our bug reports on Trello, we shared it with Radioactive Magic. They were surprised at the amount of bugs we found and were glad that we reported all of them so that they could be fixed in future releases of the game.</p>
