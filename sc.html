<p class="topParagraphs" tabindex="0">At the end of April we had a one week internship at Safety Culture to see how they did software testing/quality assurance. 
    We were split up and embedded into the different teams that they had, I was placed with the On-boarding Team which focused on user experiences and usability testing with their iAuditor app.</p>

<p class="topParagraphs" tabindex="0">While I was embedded into the On-boarding Team, I worked with their QA and helped with some of the testing activities. First I tested the latest build of the iAuditor app so that I could get more familiar with it. 
    While testing it I found a few minor bugs, and one major bug that involved being able to get past an image upload limit.</p>

<p class="bottomParagraphs" tabindex="0">I wrote up acceptance criteria and text cases for one of their newest features on the iAuditor app, I made sure that the acceptance criteria made sense for the developers and discussed some of the things they wanted to achieve with the new feature. 
    Apart from that I also took part in their stand-ups, took part in blitz testing in which we all tested the same feature with different mobile devices, and also took part in their planning meeting for the next feature that they were going to work on.</p>

<h1 class="workHeaders" tabindex="0"> What I Gained: </h1>
</div>

<p class="topParagraphs" tabindex="0">The internship at Safety Culture gave me valuable insight of how cross-functional teams work together on different features/issues, how communication between each team member is extremely important, and understanding more about the different roles that can be present within a team. </p>
<p class="bottomParagraphs" tabindex="0">I learned about how acceptance criteria can help with determining what conditions a software feature must meet in order for it to be accepted by stakeholders or the end users. 
    I also learned how to develop test cases and their use in determining whether a feature meets its requirements or rather its design needs to be redone.</p>
