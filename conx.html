</div>

<p class="mainParagraphs" tabindex="0">I along with the rest of the Test-Ed team worked for a start-up called ConX Jobs on February 2018 as software testers focusing on usability. 
    ConX Jobs had a job portal website that mainly focused on the construction industry and that would mainly target tradesmen.</p>

<div class="headerContainer">
<h2 class="workHeaders" tabindex="0">Our Understanding from the Client</h2>
</div>

<p class="topParagraphs" tabindex="0">The problem they were solving in the market is providing clients (those who hire tradesmen) a realistic, concrete, and almost tangible picture of their skills, experiences, and qualifications in order to make quick but informed hires.</p>

<p class="middleParagraphs" tabindex="0">Unlike normal job boards (such as Seek or Indeed) the pre-screening would have already been done and evidence would be provided.</p>

<p class="bottomParagraphs" tabindex="0">At that time the most critical thing was to retain the user from start to finish of the user lifecycle. 
They were looking to gain traffic and scale up in order to please their stakeholders, which wasnâ€™t going to happen if their website kept experiencing user drop-off. 
So our testing focused on friction points from signing up, filling in the forms, entering information and so on.</p>

<div class="headerContainer">
<h2 class="workHeaders" tabindex="0">Our Approach</h2>
</div>

<p class="mainParagraphs" tabindex="0">The initial approach we took was as a general user (a tradesman). 
  We used that to find the most pressing issues (friction points) before they went on to deliver to a focus group or do A-B testing. We planned to  test via the web and on mobile devices.</p>

<div class="headerContainer" >
<h2 class="workHeaders" tabindex="0">Bug Reporting and Other Documentation</h2>
</div>

<p class="topParagraphs" tabindex="0">We made a spreadsheet in order to document all of the bugs we found including what devices we were using, whether we were logged in or not, the replication steps, as well as our own notes related to the bug (such as why we thought it was a bug).</p>

<p class = "middleParagraphs"><a target="_blank"><img src="ConX-1.png" style='width:100%;' alt="Null"></a></p>

<p class="middleParagraphs" tabindex="0">We also decided to make a diagram showing the points of friction/drop off that users may go through during the sign-up process. Friction points were dropped down into the orange zone and drop off points were dropped down into the red zone. 
Each bug of a specific section was listed underneath it and they each included links to screenshots showing the specific bug.</p>

<p class = "middleParagraphs"><a target="_blank"><img src="ConX-2.png" style='width:100%;' alt="Null"></a></p>

<p class="bottomParagraphs" tabindex="0">After our testing concluded, we presented our findings to the client including all of the different bugs and their affects on the user journey through the ConX site. The client was happy with the amount of issues we found and believed that the evidence we provided would be able to persuade the devs to work on them before moving on with new features.</p>
